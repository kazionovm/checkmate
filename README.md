## How it works?
* Tree Search to predict the moves that should be taken by the policy to reach the final winning solution.
* Minimax + Beam search to prune that value function.

## Training set
* We trained our nn using board data from [lichess elite database](https://database.nikonoel.fr/)
* `6.11.2020` - I had managed to serialize 305339 chess games and got 25 millions board positions
